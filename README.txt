SampleFromRegex
===============
Simple program with gui which creates sample string from regular expression. 
It uses xeger lib, which is included into build.
Java is required for this program to work. I'd recomend version 7, but should also work on others.

To start program run .jar from dist folder by double clicking it. If this doesn't work use
java -jar SampleFromRegex.jar

Should work on windows linux and mac.

You can also download sources and build it using ant script.
